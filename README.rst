General Description
====================

**Pet Health in Real Time.**

CompanionCare is an app that helps conscientious pet partners manage the care of pets in need. Aging pets and pets with chronic health conditions often need to see many different vets and take many medications. Using a custom-scraped database of pet medications, CompanionCare tracks your pets' prescriptions — even sending responsive SMS alerts to keep you on top of doses, providing information on what to do if you miss a pill, and tracking prescribing vets to help you reach out when you need to. CompanionCare also helps document your pets’ lives in sickness and in health with photo uploads and lets you see an overview of the healthcare for all your pets with custom data visualizations.
