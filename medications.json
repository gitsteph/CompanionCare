            "Acepromazine is the most common tranquilizer and central nervous system depressant given to pets. It is used to prevent anxiety associated with thunder, fireworks, vet or groomer visits, and other things your pet may fear. It is effective treatment against motion sickness and nausea associated with car or plane rides.",

The process of shutting the protien synthesis down is not rapid. For this reason treatments using Tetracycline are generally termed as a long term treatment. It takes some time after the process is shut down until NSAIDs work by reducing the enzyme COX-2. These enzymes are involved in the formation of prostaglandins, which cause swelling and inflammation. Reduction of these factors reduce the pain and inflammation your pet experiences.",

        "General Description": [
            "Ranitidine is a histamine (H2) blocker that is used to prevent and treat stomach and intestinal ulcers in cats and dogs. It is often prescribed in the cases of gastritis and in the management of acid reflux disease to soothe inflammation and assist in healing. It also assists in stimulating the passage of food through the digestive tract.",

            "Give this medication without food, as food will decrease it\u2019s effectiveness.",

        ],
        "How It Works": [
            "Histamine is a key component in the allergic reaction, causing inflammation and swelling. It can often cause stomach cramping and diarrhea as well. By inhibiting the H2 receptor, a receptor for histamine, Ranitidine reduces the output of stomach acid. This reduces the pH of the digestive system, giving the ulcer in the stomach time and a more favorable environment to rest and heal.",

        "Missed Dose?": [
            "Give the dose as soon as possible. If it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose, and continue with the regular schedule. Do not give your pet two doses at once.",
